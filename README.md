# lung_cancer
Hello! This is a project that aims to predict lung cancer based on a lung cancer survey dataset. The dataset contains information about patients' medical histories, lifestyle habits, and other factors that are associated with lung cancer.

The project uses two machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on the input features. The KNN algorithm predicts the likelihood of lung cancer by finding the K nearest data points in the dataset and using their outcomes to classify new cases. The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane that separates the data into two classes (lung cancer and non-lung cancer) and then uses this hyperplane to classify new cases.

# Requirements

To run the project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
